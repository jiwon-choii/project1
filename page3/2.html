      <p>One other little punctuation mark one can have feelings about and that is the apostrophe for possession. 
        Well feel as you like about that, I can see and I do see that for many that for some the possessive case apostrophe has a gentle tender insinuation that makes it very difficult to definitely decide to do without it. 
        One does do without it, I do, I mostly always do, but I cannot deny that from time to time I feel myself having regrets and from time to time I put it in to make the possessive case.
        I absolutely do not like it and leaving it out I feel no regret, there it is unnecessary and not ornamental but inside a word and its s well perhaps, perhaps it does appeal by its weakness to your weakness. At least at any rate from time to time I do find myself letting it alone if it has come in and sometimes it has come in.
        I cannot positively deny but that I do from time to time let it come in. 
        So now to come to the real question of punctuation, periods, commas, colons, semi-colons and capitals and small letters. 
        I have had a long and complicated life with all these.
